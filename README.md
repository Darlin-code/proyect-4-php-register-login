# **project-4-php-register-login.**

### **How to use if you are new (At least more than me).**

*1. __Import__ the DB to your __database management system__.*

*2. Once the DB has been imported, go to the __pdo.php__ file and update it.
    first the host, then the port, the dbname leave it the same, and enter your user
    and password to finish.*

___Note: Login is required for___ $_SESSION["USER_AUTH"] ___to be set.
         Or declare it yourself, but lose the fun.___
